Turning complex data into clear insights, one fuzzy match at a time.

###########################################

This code performs fuzzy name matching between two Excel files to classify names into categories based on
 their presence in either file. It loads the Excel files, processes the names to handle variations and potential 
 typos, and then uses fuzzy matching to determine if names from one file exist in the other. Names in the first file 
 (ss1) are marked as 'admis' if they have a match in the second file (ss2); otherwise, they are marked as 'sortant'. 
 Conversely, names in the second file (ss2) are marked as 'entrant' if they do not have a match in the first file (ss1). 
 The results are then saved into new Excel files.
